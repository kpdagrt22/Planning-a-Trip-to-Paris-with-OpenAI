# Planning-a-Trip-to-Paris-with-OpenAI
creating a chatbot using the OpenAI API to generate responses to the following Parisian tourist questions





How far away is the Louvre from the Eiffel Tower (in miles) if you are driving?
Where is the Arc de Triomphe?
What are the must-see artworks at the Louvre Museum?
Create a list of dictionaries called conversation that lists the 'role' and 'content' for each question and response. You should start the conversation with a 'system' message to set the model's behavior, and use a temperature of 0.0 and maximum number of tokens of 100:
[ {"role": "system", "content": ...}, {"role": "user", "content": ...}, ... ]
