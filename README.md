creating a chatbot using the OpenAI API to generate responses to the following Parisian tourist questions




Parisian Travel Guide AI Project

Commissioned by Peterman Reality Tours, this project uses the OpenAI API to create an AI-powered travel guide for Paris, launched on June 21, 2025, at 01:02 PM IST. Designed as a virtual Parisian expert, it delivers concise, accurate responses to tourist queries, enhancing travel planning for a global audience.

Built with the "gpt-4o-mini" model (temperature 0.0, max 100 tokens), the AI starts with a system message setting its role as a knowledgeable guide. It handles questions about landmarks like the Louvre (3.5 miles from the Eiffel Tower), Arc de Triomphe (Place Charles de Gaulle), and must-see artworks (e.g., Mona Lisa). Implemented in Python with the OpenAI client, it offers an interactive interface with a conversation history of roles ("system," "user," "assistant") and content.

This solution supports Petermanâ€™s vision of an immersive, seamless travel experience, adaptable for all visitors. Future enhancements may include web searches or image analysis for real-time insights, reinforcing its role as a cutting-edge travel tool.
